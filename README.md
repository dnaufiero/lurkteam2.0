# lurkteam2.0 <br />
Website that allows you to lurk in streams, only displaying the streams that are currently live. <br />
 <br />
<br />
Todo: <br />
<br />
-Separate out JS into its own file, to avoid having it in the main page <br />
-Add bootstrap template <br />
-Add side slide menu with settings <br />
-Convert textarea to a popout. Single text box with a toggle box to switch to bulk entry (text area) <br />
-Display streams as individual boxes (rounded bootstrap edges) with the profile image/offline image (pull from API?) in
  a small grid below the main grid of live streams (reponsive). Offline stream boxes will be 1/2 to 1/4 size of currently
  playing stream boxes <br />
-Make a logo, put up top <br />
-Copyright information on the bottom <br />
-FAQ page <br />
-first time page is loaded, display a short FAQ in the center of the page <br />
-add offline "jokes" to be displayed when no streams are currently playing <br />
-when a stream goes on cooldown, dont destroy the div, replace the contents with a the stream name, and indicate that it
  is on cooldown, not offline <br />
-*MAYBE*: allow the person to back up their settings to a site database with a username that they enter (don't require login)
  and allow them to enter that username upon loading the site on a new computer, etc, with the notion that anyone could use their
  settings if they typed their username (maybe automatically backup settings and link to twitch account?) <br />
-*MAYBE*: allow the user to log into Twitch from the site, and display that the user is logged in <br />
